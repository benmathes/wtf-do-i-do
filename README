based on principles from http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_choosing_what_to_choose.html
1) cut (down to 4)
2) concretize (see "gut" and "personal reaction to photos of offices, location")
3) categorize
4) condition: start with fewer choices in multi-dimensional approach 
   (order I filled out categories is top-> bottom, or fewer criteria -> more criteria)

note that these are NOT absolute ratings on companies, 
just my sense on how me and the company fit.
